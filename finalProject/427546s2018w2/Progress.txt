Progress - Week 2

At this moment, I have implemented the transformations to the created object.
The tranformations include translate, rotate, scale, and shear. These work very well with the created object.
I currently only have one object, which is a house. I have successfully created the 3 elevations to be viewed separately. 
Unlike the 1st week that these elevations could only be viewed all at once.

So far, the user can choose to view the house from the 3 elevations, which are front, top, and side.
They can also choose to transform the object by choosing the options from the "Transformations" panel.
