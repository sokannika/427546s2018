How the program run:

As of right now, there is no functionality in this program yet. I am currently working on getting the shape right first before trying to get the functionality right.
So, right now, all three elevations are shown in one picture. There is only one object present, which is a house.

During the work in progress, the program should take user inputs for starting point, and allow user to change objects and elevations.
