Progress - Week 3

This week I'm focusing on creating 3D object and movement. My code is supposed to have an animation of a sphere going around the image.
I created a new folder. The main purpose of this folder is to test all the new features that I'm currently creating to my main working code. Therefore, this week I'm only including the test folder. This folder consists of an html file that simply display a picture with a sphere moving around the picture creating bump-like appearance. Since the picture is smaller than the canvas, so the effect might take a few seconds to see the sphere moving.
