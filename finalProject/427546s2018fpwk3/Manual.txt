So far there is only one object that the user can view, which is a house.
The house can be viewed by selecting one of the elevations (front, top, side), then click "Draw" in "Inputs" panel.

To see transformation of the object, the user has to select one of the transformations radio buttons (translate, rotate, scale, and shear).
User has to enter the input in the textbox(es) following the selected radio button. 
For example, if "Translate" is selected, user has to enter values for x and y. Otherwise, no changes will be seen.
