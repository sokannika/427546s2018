Manual - Week 3

This week, my focus is on creating 3D objects, movement, and views. In order to prevent errors on my current code, I created a whole new file just for testing new features that will be adding to the original code regularly.

For this week, the test only display an image with a sphere moving outward the screen behind the picture. There is no user interaction yet in this file. Once the code is running, it might take a few seconds to see the movement of the sphere because the picture I selected is smaller than the canvas I created.
