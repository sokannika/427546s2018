In this assignment, I do the programming using Visual Studio. This run will run by just running html file in Chrome. If open in Internet Explorer, all the functionality will not work.

For implementing drawing the line, circle, and ellipse, I followed the instruction, which is provided in Professor Haim's slides.
Overall, I think the code runs well, except for drawing ellipse. The shape is a bit out, and I couldn't quite figure out why.
